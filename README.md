# Nonparametric Goodness-of-fit Tests for Positive Quadrant Dependence

Here we provide numerical illustrations with R codes for the paper "Goodness-of-fit Test for Positive Quadrant Dependence." 
In addition, all the numerical results in the paper can be reproduced by using the codes provided here. 

## R Code Demonstration

## Simulation Results

## Data Analysis

### Age versus Salary

### Human Development Index and Covid-19

### Twins, Education, and Stocks data, from Tang et al. (2019)
Lastly, we implemented the proposed GOF tests to test if the three datasets, Twins, Education, and Stocks data, from Tang et al. (2019), satisfy PQD.
