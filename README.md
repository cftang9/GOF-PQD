# Goodness-of-fit tests for positive quadrant dependence

Here we provide numerical illustrations with R codes for the paper "Goodness-of-fit Test for Positive Quadrant Dependence." 
Additionally, all the numerical results in the paper can be reproduced using the codes provided here. 

## R Code Demonstration

### A simple example

### For your own dataset

## Simulation Results

## Data Analysis

### NCAA basketball attendance data

### Danish insurance data

### Necrotizing enterocolitis data







Lastly, we implemented the proposed GOF tests to test if the three datasets, Twins, Education, and Stocks data, from Tang et al. (2019), satisfy PQD.
